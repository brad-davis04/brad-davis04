- 👋 Hi, I’m @brad-davis04
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about artificial intelligence, particularly in image and video analysis, but I'm pretty new to it so I'm open to learning a bit of everything too
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Statistical modelling, Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning at Monash University. My aim is to learn about the background of AI as fast and in as much detail as is helpful to my career, so I'm just deepdiving at the moment to see what there is to learn. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much yet. I am hoping to have some projects to work on and learn from soon.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email @ brad.davis04@gmail.com
